This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This project uses **pnpm** (not npm). Install pnpm if needed: `corepack enable pnpm`.

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Set `RESEND_API_KEY` in `.env` for OTP and transactional emails (Resend). Optionally set `RESEND_FROM` (e.g. `noreply@yourdomain.com`) when using a verified domain.

### Database & first login (deployment)

The app does **not** run database migrations or seeds automatically during build. To have users and data so you can log in:

1. **Option A – Release command (recommended)**  
   In your host (e.g. Railway), set the **Release Command** to:
   ```bash
   pnpm run release
   ```
   This runs `prisma db push` and `prisma db seed` before each deploy, so the schema is applied and seed users exist.

2. **Option B – One-time manual**  
   After the first deploy, with `DATABASE_URL` pointing at your production DB, run locally:
   ```bash
   pnpm run db:push
   pnpm run db:seed
   ```

Seed creates demo users you can use to log in:

- **Acme:** `admin@acme.com` / `admin123`
- **Admin:** `gkozyris@i4ria.com` / `1f1femsk`

Change or add users in `prisma/seed.ts` and re-run `pnpm run db:seed` as needed.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
